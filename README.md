# this_os_needs_a_name
My custom os I'm working on, I've just started working on it, I'm currently using the Limine bootloader. Or, I suppose it would be more accurate to say I'm setting up the Limine bootloader.
My current goal is to get a simple terminal working, and then keep building it up from there.
